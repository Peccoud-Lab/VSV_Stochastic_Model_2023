The Python script excel_to_SBML.py takes two excel spreadsheets and returns a model in xml format. An example of these spreadsheets is provided with initial_quantities.xlsx and Model_Reaction_Input.xlsx. To generate a model run the following code in the shell:


$ python3 Model_Reaction_Input.xlsx initial_quantities.xlsx model.xml

This will generate an xml file named model.xml to store the new model.
